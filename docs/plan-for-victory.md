# Detailed plan for Victory

The aim of this plan is to be a meta-plan as concrete as possible. This will help us keep an eye on the path the project is taking.

[Big project mistakes are usually](https://www.benkuhn.net/pjm/): not freaking out soon enough, slowly moving off-plan, not working on top-priority items, prioritizing wrongly and incomplete information about system behavior. This should help us avoid those.

Our primary concern is going fast and staying on the track we consciously choose to follow.

This plan is updated every Sunday by @Apros7 (Lucas Vilsen)

## Upcomings goals:
1. Have a working product for sorting waste at Startup Day on Thursday, 15th of May.
2. Sort >5 tons of waste May 26th, 27th & 28th.


## Plan (in ranked order of priority)
1. Improve EasyLabeller to a usable state and label first 1000 images.
2. Autoupload and perform selection in samples needed for manual labelling to improve AI sorting.
3. Have a complete pipeline for recognizing and calculating object 3d positions running faster than >20it/min on Jetson.
4. Develop first beta version of Customer Portal (and show information about CO2, weight, sorting accuracy).
5. Autoupload information (Weight, CO2, classification) to SupaBase at least every 6 hours.
