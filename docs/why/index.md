# Easysort

Easysort is made with the purpose of improving production lines and waste facilities to optimize efficiency by providing evidence for high impact actions for both economical and environmental benefit.

Easysort is currently used on waste recycling centers and on waste containers on building sites to control the quality of the input, sorting and output of the facility.

# How it works

Easysort uses computer vision to identify products, materials or waste in the frame of the camera. We build and install simply camera boxes at your location (or integrate them into your existing camera system), then use that information to carefully identify the composition of the items at different steps in your production line thereby providing the evidence needed to identify the root cause of inefficiencies, help predict incoming bad loads and relieve the burden on the operators/personnel.

You can try our vision models on our website ([easysort.org](https://easysort.org)) and try the tracking view for our waste facility customers on our tracking website ([track.easysort.org](https://track.easysort.org)).

We set up our service on a single day, usually without you having to stop your production at all. Within just a couple of weeks of service, you will have valuable insights into your production line, have predictability on incoming loads and feel the burden of monitoring reduced.
