There are many players doing AI/Robotic sorting in the waste industry. Easysort is the only open source solution.

Below is a list of most players. First lets make a broader distinction between the players.

### 2 Groups

1. **Complete large scale sorting**
    Companies here include: ZenRobotics, AMP Robotics, Waste Robotics, Tomra and Banzo.

    Usually both sensors and robots, sometimes provided through partners. Some build the facilities for others, some through partners. These systems are expensive, require large space, high lead time (usually >6 months), and hard to install into existing operations. This issues make it hard to existing operators to upgrade their operations and have a clear ROI.

2. **Monitoring systems**
    Companies here include: Sortrace, Aris Robotics, WeSortAI and GreyParrot.

    These companies provide monitoring systems in one form or another. They are not focused on sorting, but rather on monitoring the waste stream. GreyParrot is the only company which can be used with robots. They are overpriced, at times hard to install as large sensors are required.  

**How is Easysort different?**

The most present issue in the industry is the correction classification of waste and estimation of purity. As such systems are highly overpriced, it is hard to justify the investment. Many of them don't directly provide a modular approach to adding robots, which makes it hard to scale.

Easysort is focused on making an easy-to-install, high-performing detection system. It is modular, open source and can be installed into existing operations in a cost effective way. Down the line, we expect to be able to provide robots that can be added to the system. Our goal is to make the most reliable, modular and cost effective solution for small and existing scale sorting. 

### Each player in depth

Here is a list of most players in the market and their approach to waste sorting rated in the following categories:

- **Cost:** (Without Taxes/Tariffs) Low/Medium/High (based on information from website - must prices are hidden, which is common for this industry)
- **Lead Time:** Time from order/contact to company until working solution
- **Space Required:** Low (<10m2), Medium (10-100m2), High (>100m2)
- **Integration:** Easy/Medium/Hard - How well the product integrates with existing operations (Hard = New conveyor belt & large changes to existing operations, Medium=  Some changes to existing operations, Easy = No or minimal changes to existing operations)
- **Full Solution:** Yes/No if the company provides both robot, integration and vision system
- **Open Source:** Yes/No if code for the solution is open source.

| Sortrace | --- | --- | --- | --- | No | No |
| LogiWaste | --- | Long | High | Hard | No | No |
| Waste Robotics | 2.5-3.5 mil. | 12 weeks | High | Medium | Yes, but through partner | No |
| Banzo | 
| Tomra |
| Easysort | 15-200k | 2-8 weeks | Low | Easy | Yes | Yes |

### ZenRobotics

[ZenRobotics](https://www.terex.com/zenrobotics) is the most established player in the market. They provide AI camera, Delta robots for picking and a complete sorting solution, which they help implemented at site locations. The solution is extremely large, hard to install and expensive. They seem to be the best solution for large scale sorting, but not for small and existing scale sorting.

**Pros:** Large scale sorting, high accuracy, complete solution

**Cons:** Expensive, hard to install, large space required, High lead time.

### AMP Robotics

[AMP Robotics](https://ampsortation.com/products/single-stream) is the a close runner-up to ZenRobotics. They provide AI camera, Air Jet solution, Delta robots and a complete sorting solution called AMP One. Again, the solution is extremely large, hard to install and expensive. They're good for large scale sorting, but not for small and existing scale sorting.

**Pros:** Large scale sorting, high accuracy, complete solution

**Cons:** Expensive, hard to install, large space required, High lead time.

### WeSortAI

[WeSortAI](https://www.wesortai.com/) makes complete sorting solutions with either RGB (general vision) or X-Ray scanner (batteries) and a Air Jet solution is installed after. The performance of the system seems high. The modularity is debatable, and the operations of the facility in which this is installed has to be changed significantly in order to implement this solution. Price/Lead time not known.

**Pros:** Large scale sorting, high accuracy, complete solution

**Cons:** Hard to install, modularity is debatable, does not fit into existing operations.

### Aris Robotics

[Aris Robotics](https://www.aris-robotics.com/) provide a fully camera based solution mostly to consumer facing sorting centers (recycling centers, where people deliver their (sorted) waste). They try to fix the issue by helping humans sort the waste better. This is not a bad approach, but long term not were the industry should be going. Price/Lead time not known. Based from their website, price seems a higher than Easysort, lead time equivalent. 

**Pros:** Consumer facing, easy to install

**Cons:** Camera (RGB) based, not for central sorting by machines.

### Recycleye

[Recycleye](https://recycleye.com/) is ...

Only camera, camera based, low cost:

### GreyParrot

[GreyParrot](https://www.greyparrot.ai/) is the closest competitor to Easysort Eye. They provide a camera (RGB) based box that can be installed directly into existing operations. They provide insights into the waste stream, but not a complete sorting solution. Price/Lead time not known. Price is significantly higher than Easysort Eye and is paid on a subscription basis. AI performs well, but not super customizable. They pair with Waste Robotics to provide a complete solution, although this solution seems to be expensive!

**Pros:** Installed directly into existing operations, insights into waste stream, AI performs well.

**Cons:** Camera (RGB) based, no robotic sorting, subscription based, not for large scale sorting.

### Sortrace

[Sortrace](https://sortrace.com/) is focusing on municipalities and providing a solution for waste vehicles. Sortrace has no solution yet, but seems to be based on a simple RGB camera. No price/lead time known. Their idea is to put the solution onto waste vehicles, which is a good approach. Since they have to real solution yet, it is hard to say more.

### LogiWaste

[LogiWaste](https://logiwaste.com/dk/) is a consumer facing solution, where robotic sorting happenes at the source with waste suction. This is extremely expensive, and in no way a solution that scales with the industry. The company does not seem to be present in Denmark anylonger, but based and still active in Sweden. Price/Lead time not known, but expected to be high. Hard to say more.

### Waste Robotics

[Waste Robotics](https://www.waste-robotics.com/) develop and sell a robotic sorting solution with robot arms. They partner with GreyParrot to provide a complete solution. The solution is expensive, although fairly quick to install and somewhat modular. Again, large changes to existing operations are required.

**Pros:** Large scale sorting, high accuracy, complete solution, somewhat modular.

**Cons:** Expensive, requires large changes to existing operations, large space required, Medium lead time.

### Banzo

[Banzo](https://banzo.nl/) builds complete sorting facilities mostly using others technology. Tomra is one of their partners. Banzo provides a complete solution when it comes to sorting.

**Pros:** Large scale sorting, high accuracy, complete solution, custom solutions.

**Cons:** Expensive, really only for new facilities, large space required, High lead time (~2 years for a small facility)

### Tomra

[Tomra](https://www.tomra.com/) develops machines and sensors for many machine applications usually regarding carbon footprint in some way. They are a leader in this field. Tomra does not provide a complete solution and does not build facilities themselves. They sell their technology to other partners, which then build the facilities.

**Pros:** Large scale sorting, high accuracy, modular

**Cons:** Really expensive, only through partners

### Easysort

If you've read through all of this, it should be clear where Easysort is positioned.

We are the only open source solution on the market. We provide a complete solution, which is easy to install, highly modular and integrate with existing operations. We are the best solution for small and existing scale sorting. Due to the frequent updates in this industry, most facilities are not willing to invest in a complete robotic solution for multiple millions. With our solution, facilities can slowly upgrade and expand as needed. We are by far the cheapest, most transparent solution on the market.

**Pros:** Low cost, easy to install, easy to integrate, modular, open source

**Cons:** Mostly smaller scale sorting, entirely vision (RGB) based, not for large scale sorting
