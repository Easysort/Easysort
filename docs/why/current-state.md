## Demo of Easysort 1.0 on building site (Expected: November 2025)

We are modifying the Easysort 1.0 unit to work on a building site. This will be a great opportunity to test our solution in a more static environment, with a lot of variability in the waste stream and a lot of unknowns. Waste facilities are increasingly interested in such a solution to help optimize their operations with incoming loads, so exploring such an option is a fairly high value opportunity.

## First 10 Easysort 1.0 units deployed (Expected: November 2025)

We expect to copy our approach for the first Easysort 1.0 unit to deploy 10 more units across 5 different centers. The main reason is to test our solution in a larger scale and find early issues with our systems.

## First Facility-Wide Deployed Easysort Sorting System (October 2025)

Full integration of the Easysort Sorting System working across 10+ cameras and helping optimize waste operations, identifying incoming loads and automating dull monitoring tasks. Great way for us to test our solution in a much more varying setup with a bunch of unknowns and gain insights into the real issues a waste facility is facing.

## First Deployed Easysort 1.0 unit (September 2025)

The first Easysort 1.0 unit deployed to a recycling center in Denmark monitoring the incoming and outgoing recyclables from a tent. We are able to detect ~400 items per week per camera. This offers a great opportunity to test our solution early on, gain training data, test both our vision and estimation models and actually provide some value.

## Demo of Easysort 1.0 / Easysort Sorting System (June  2025)

First successfull implementation of the Easysort Sorting System working with 5 integrated existing cameras and a single Easysort 1.0 unit. We were able to correctly capture 43 incoming loads over 5 days and detect 67 items of high importance for operators to act on. 3 of the incoming loads were classified as critical and all 3 was verified as positive detections by the operators.

## Successful DTU Project (March 2025)

A small scale, complete robotic sorting system was built in 2024 and tested at DTU in March 2025. This proved that the technology is possible.

We sorted ~53 kg of residual waste over 2 days. We correctly classified 70% of the waste. Although we had problems with picking operation, we managed to sort ~170 different items away from the main waste stream fully automatically.

In addition to this, we also showed that a larger majority of the waste in the residual waste stream should not be incinerated, and that a solution that could post-sort waste would be highly beneficial.
