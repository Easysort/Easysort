## Successful DTU Project

A small scale, complete robotic sorting system was built in 2024 and tested at DTU in March 2025. This proved that the technology is possible.

We sorted ~53 kg of residual waste over 2 days. We correctly classified 70% of the waste. Although we had problems with picking operation, we managed to sort ~170 different items away from the main waste stream fully automatically.

In addition to this, we also showed that a larger majority of the waste in the residual waste stream should not be incinerated, and that a solution that could post-sort waste would be highly beneficial.

The full results can be found at [track.easysort.org](https://track.easysort.org) by typing the code `DTU`. 

## Easysort 1.0

A demo version of the Easysort 1.0 has been built. We are currently testing it and will deploy our first version at a waste sorting facility in Denmark August 2025. Additionally, another unit will be deployed in September 2025.
