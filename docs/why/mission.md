# Our mission

End human waste sorting forever with autonomous robots while delivering shippable intermediate products.

# Why

First it should be stated that Easysort should never exist. The EU chased quick results, and pushed the responsibility of waste sorting onto the individual as opposed to funding the necessary infrastructure. This is not right. Easysort is fixing this problem.

# Identifying the problem

Most technology to sort waste already exists. Most is too expensive and kept out of reach for most facilities by the companies behind it. Easysort takes these technologies and builds bridges to make them available at a price that makes sense.

# Open-source:

We want to free people from the burden of waste sorting with a solution owned by the public. In this way, no company can control and use technology as it is freely available to everyone. All our projects, plans and daily communication are free for everyone to see and use.

# Vision:

Long term, Easysort will have or supply tools for large sorting facilities sorting all your waste into specific fractions for recycling centers to use.
Short term, Easysort sells intermediate AI monitoring products to waste sorting facilities to help them sort and understand waste. This helps us test our technology, we make an impact from day one, and prepare for our own facilities.
