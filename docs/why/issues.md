# Industry Problems

What are the issues in this industry? Where should you focus in order to make an impact?

Generally the industry is facing 3 main issues:

1. **Data**: Missing data about where waste comes from, what it is, and what effect it has.
2. **Money**: Current systems are too expensive for operators to buy. Government funding is often required to make a downpayment for such systems.
3. **Performance**: Existing systems have issues with sorted fractions from the system only being of mediocre purity levels and missing recyclables in the unsorted fraction. Food waste is a large issue.
