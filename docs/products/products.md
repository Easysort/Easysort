# Products

At Easysort, we have a single main product in addition to our sorting software.

## Easysort Sorting Software

Free waste sorting software running to analyze all waste types, purity, weight, size and estimate value if sorted correctly.

We can help you configure and run the software on your own infrastructure and host it for you. Contact: lucas@easysort.org.

## Easytrack (track.easysort.org)

View your cloud data from your easysort 1.0 or implementation of Easysort Sorting Software in the web.

## Easysort 1.0

The Easysort 1.0 is: Lights + Camera + AI + Onboard Compute + Data management all in one unit.

It is currently being used for 3 things: 

1) to detect incoming waste and notify the user of critical detections, generate reports generally on the waste stream and link waste scans to specific trucks.

2) monitoring of waste containers on site to provide visibility into the waste stream for the sorting facility and management of the waste stream.

3) quality control for incoming waste streams on conveyor belts.

## Perspectives on a full sorting system

The full Sorting System would require: Easysort 1.0 (or equivalent) + Robotic Sorting System + Control System + Analytics.

You give the system any kind of mixed waste stream from 90% pure to residual waste and you get a complete sorted waste stream.

The best way to do robotic sorting is still to be determined. Generally 3 main options are possible:
1. Delta Robot (Easy to implement, high precision, cheaper, slower speeds)
2. Smart Conveyor (Pushing waste through actuators in conveyor. High speeds, high precision, expensive and hard to implement)
3. Air cylinder (Blasting waste with air to move it. High speeds, difficult to move heavy objects, hard to implement) (leading option due to the high volume requirements)
