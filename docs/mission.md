# Our mission:

End human waste sorting forever with autonomous robots while delivering shippable intermediate products.

# Why:

Politicians and higher-ups have pushed the responsibility of waste sorting onto the individual as opposed to funding the necessary infrastructure. This is not right.

We want to free people from the burden of waste sorting with a solution owned by the public. In this way, no company can control and use them, but freely available to everyone.

# Open-source:

In the future, robots and intelligent systems will be perform many tasks for humans. They are also going to sort all our waste.

We want to make sure that robots doing key tasks in society are open-sourced: not owned by a company that can control you, but freely available to everyone. 
This is why we are open-sourcing everything we do.

# Vision:

- Do we really want tech billionaries or do we really want tech: https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/chinas-subsidies-create-not-destroy-value/# + Hefie model for goverment VC funds

Let’s build technology and open source software that market breaks everything. Let’s demoralize the scammers so hard that they don’t even try. Every loser and grifter will be gone from technology because there’s nothing to be gained there. They can play golf all day or something.

If I ever figure out how to channel power like Elon, I will do this. Spin up open source projects in every sector to eliminate all the capturable value. This is what I’m trying to do with comma.ai and tinygrad. I dream of a day when company valuations halve when I create a GitHub repo. Someday.
