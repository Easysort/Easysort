# Our mission:

End human waste sorting forever with autonomous robots while delivering shippable intermediate products.

# Why:

Politicians and higher-ups have pushed the responsibility of waste sorting onto the individual as opposed to funding the necessary infrastructure. This is not right.

We want to free people from the burden of waste sorting with a solution owned by the public. In this way, no company can control and use them, but freely available to everyone.

# Open-source:

In the future, robots and intelligent systems will be perform many tasks for humans. They are also going to sort all our waste.

We want to make sure that robots doing key tasks in society are open-sourced: not owned by a company that can control you, but freely available to everyone. 
This is why we are open-sourcing everything we do.
