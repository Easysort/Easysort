# Welcome to EasySort

[Easysort](https://github.com/EasySort/easysort) is an open source waste sorting system. Currently, Easysort performs the function of waste classification and purity estimation. Additionally, Easysort will in the future include size, weight and value of each object to prioritize sorting.

## How do I use it?

Easysort is designed to work on our Easysort 1.0 Camera Device.

## How does it work?

Easysort predicts information about objects from a simple RGB image, providing crucial information to sorting operaters on the waste stream, and opening the door for more complex sorting solutions.

## Why EasySort?

At Easysort we try to make the best, most reliable waste detection system. 

One of the most challenging problems in not only the waste industry, but generally in AI, is detecting a large range of highly mutated objects in a unknown, variable enviroment (not to mention doing so on different camera types, lightning conditions, etc).

In the waste industry, the most central issue is the identification of waste fractions and purity both for operators and researchers. With Easysort we aim to provide a high quality, reliable and easy to use system for this.

We develop intermediate products to provide value, train and test our approach.

Easysort will forever be open source, and if we just somewhat achieve our goal, not only will waste handling and recycling become cheaper and see improvements, but the foundation for likewise approaching in other foundational industries will be laid.

## Why the waste industry?

Europe pushed the resposibility of sorting waste to the citizens. This is expensive both in time and money, but also inefficient. Easysort is paving the way for intelligent, robotic sorting, which improves the efficiency and reduces the cost of sorting waste for every party involved.

So why was the responsibility pushed to the citizens in the first place? The main reasons complete automated waste sorting hasn't happened yet is: 1) the cost of the technology is too high and 2) the recognition systems are not good enough. Having one central system pushing the technology forward, and making that technology as cheap as possible, is one way to solve both problems.

Crucial technology should be so cheap that basically no one profits. This is why most of Easysort is open source. Let's make one good solution for everyone, and make it free for the world to use, improve and build on.
