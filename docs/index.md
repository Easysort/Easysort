# Welcome to EasySort

[Easysort](https://github.com/EasySort/easysort) is an open source waste sorting system. Currently, Easysort performs the function of waste classification and purity estimation. Additionally, Easysort is starting to include size, weight and value of each object to prioritize sorting.
## How do I use it?

Easysort is designed to work on our Easysort Eye.

## How does it work?

Easysort predicts information about objects from a simple RGB image, providing crucial information to sorting operaters on the waste stream, and opening the door for more complex sorting solutions.

## Why EasySort?

At Easysort we try to make the best, most reliable waste detection system.

Europe pushed the resposibility of sorting waste to the citizens. This is expensive both in time and money, but also inefficient. Easysort is paving the way for intelligent, robotic sorting, which improves the efficiency and reduces the cost of sorting waste for every party involved.

So why was the responsibility pushed to the citizens in the first place? The main reasons complete automated waste sorting hasn't happened yet is: 1) the cost of the technology is too high and 2) the recognition systems are not good enough. Having one central system pushing the technology forward, and making that technology as cheap as possible, is one way to solve both problems.

Crucial technology should be so cheap that basically no one profits. This is why Easysort is open source. Let's make one good solution for everyone, and make it free for the world to use, improve and build on.
