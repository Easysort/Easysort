# Welcome to EasySort

[Easysort](https://github.com/EasySort/easysort) is an open source waste sorting system. Currently, Easysort performs the function of waste classification and purity estimation. Additionally, Easysort is starting to include size, weight and value of each object to prioritize sorting. A controller for our demo robot at our office is also available through this repo.

## How do I use it?

Easysort is designed to work on our fitted Nvidia Jetson.

## How does it work?

Easysort predicts information about objects from a simple RGB image, providing crucial information to sorting operaters on the waste stream, and opening the door for more complex sorting solutions.

## Why EasySort?

Europe pushed the resposibility of sorting waste to the citizens. This is expensive both in time and money, but also inefficient. Easysort is paving the way for intelligent, robotic sorting, which improves the efficiency and reduces the cost of sorting waste for every party involved.

Crucial technology should be so cheap that basically no one profits. This is why Easysort is open source. Let's make one good solution for everyone, and make it free for the world to use.

## License

EasySort is open-source software. You can use it as you like - copy it, modify it, sell it. We believe in creating a positive-sum game where everyone can benefit from better sorting technology.
