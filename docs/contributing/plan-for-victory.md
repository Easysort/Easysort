# Detailed plan for Victory

The aim of this plan is to be a meta-plan as concrete as possible. This will help us keep an eye on the path the project is taking.

[Big project mistakes are usually](https://www.benkuhn.net/pjm/): not freaking out soon enough, slowly moving off-plan, not working on top-priority items, prioritizing wrongly and incomplete information about system behavior. This should help us avoid those.

Our primary concern is going fast and staying on the track we consciously choose to follow.

This plan is updated every Sunday by @Apros7 (Lucas Vilsen)
