# What is EasySort
EasySort makes you go from a sorting problem to a solution in just a couple of hours. Collect data, annotate it, train a model and you are ready to go.
In Extra we provide a set of tools to make it easier to get started.

# How to setup EasySort
...

# Why open-source?
I believe this is a positive-sum game. The market is so large that we can all win. This technology should be so cheap that it exists everywhere on earth helping everyone better sort items and improve the average quality of products running through their system.

You can use EasySort as you like, copy it, modify it, sell it, do whatever you like with it. The project is in active development, so issues and pull requests are welcome.
