This is not the best path, but since this was chose, many companies and facilities have been build around it. Most solutions currently on the market are built for full scale sorting facilities. Current sorting facilities are rather old, have highly specific operations and not designed for the future. We need to slowly convert these into fully automated facilities in a cost effective way. Easysort is a solution to this problem.</p>"},{"location":"why/mission/#open-source","title":"Open-source","text":"<p>We want to free people from the burden of waste sorting with a solution owned by the public.

Let's spend a few minutes thinking about this.</p> <p>First off, waste is always going to exist. Even with new production methods, being able to easily construct new kinds of plastics that don't have to be recycled, there will still be waste that has to be sorted. Some waste can't be burned, and some waste can't be composted. Fractions has to be split somehow, and a good detection system is in the center of that.</p> <p>Secondly, an extremely high-performing detection system is useful not only in waste sorting, but in many other applications. Although most robotic applications mostly use end-2-end systems, having good detections systems is key to 1) gathering specific data for training in difficult environments and 2) non-robotic applications. For this reason, we believe developing a good detection system is a good investment, and will be useful as we move to complete robotic sorting with end-2-end systems.</p>"},{"location":"why/stakeholders/","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<p>We will go through the main stakeholders from you put waste in the bin to the end product (recycled material or energy).

Generally you pay more, the more waste you produce, and usually also more if the waste is mixed. This is however sometimes split between multiple households. The pay increase in not sorting is minor, although you will sometimes get notifications/warnings from the municipality if you don't sort enough, which could push you to sort more. Less sorting in homes = less effort from citizens, and this is most likely a large driver.</p> <p>Impact: Highly impact the industry. If everyone wanted to and did sort correctly, the problem would be solved. The problems stem from the fact that sorting is required, but not everyone does it to perfection.</p> <p>General Opinion: Most people seem frustrated with sorting waste at home.
